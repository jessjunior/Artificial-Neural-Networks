# Artificial-Neural-Networks

This code represents a neural network model that uses an input vector and weights matrices. It is written in python programming language.
The dataset is defined in the main ANN.py file, but could also be imported from an Excel .CSV file, which is also provided. The file is ANN_data.csv.

The model consists of a neural network class that contains the methods used to prepare the data and process it before training begins. The model also allows a user to enter new data and predict an output based on the existing data through training.
